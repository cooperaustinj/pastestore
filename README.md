# PasteStore

PasteStore is a tool to persist, search, and retrieve snippets. PasteStore is not a clipboard manager. PasteStore is intended for more important and generally long-lived snippets.

# Using

The binary is not signed because that costs $99/yr. Running `xattr -cr /Applications/PasteStore.app` may be required for the app to run. You may see an error that the app is "damaged and can't be opened" if you need to do this.
